        "1.  Data cleaning:\n",
        "    -   Fix or remove outliers (optional).  \n",
        "    -   Fill in missing values (e.g., with zero, mean, median…) or drop\n",
        "        their rows (or columns).  \n",
        "2.  Feature selection (optional):\n",
        "    -   Drop the attributes that provide no useful information for the\n",
        "        task.  \n",
        "3.  Feature engineering, where appropriates:\n",
        "    -   Discretize continuous features.  \n",
        "    -   Decompose features (e.g., categorical, date/time, etc.).  \n",
        "    -   Add promising transformations of features (e.g., log(x),\n",
        "        sqrt(x), x^2, etc.).\n",
        "    -   Aggregate features into promising new features.  \n",

        "3.  Analyze the most significant variables for each algorithm.  \n",

        "\n",
        "1.  Fine-tune the hyperparameters using cross-validation.\n",

        "2.  Try Ensemble methods. Combining your best models will often perform\n",

        "1.  Document what you have done.  \n",
        "2.  Create a nice presentation.\n",
        "    -   Make sure you highlight the big picture first.  \n",
        "3.  Explain why your solution achieves the business objective.  \n",

        "    -   List your assumptions and your system’s limitations.  \n",

        "1.  Get your solution ready for production (plug into production data\n",

        "2.  Write monitoring code to check your system’s live performance at\n",
        "    regular intervals and trigger alerts when it drops.\n",
        "    -   Beware of slow degradation too: models tend to “rot” as data\n",
        "        evolves.  \n",
        "    -   Measuring performance may require a human pipeline (e.g., via a\n",
        "        crowdsourcing service).  \n",
        "    -   Also monitor your inputs’ quality (e.g., a malfunctioning sensor\n",

        "        This is particulary important for online learning systems.  \n",
